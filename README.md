Seminar: The Art of Mathematical Computer Programming

In this seminar, I intend to find a fast algorithm to calculate high powers of sparse stochastic matrices in Java.

So far, I have compared the standard multiplication algorithm to the Strassen algorithm.

Results can be found in the .txt files.
